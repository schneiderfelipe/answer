```console
$ echo "ðŸŒ­ = ðŸ¥ª?" | answer
No, a hot dog (ðŸŒ­) is not the same as a sandwich (ðŸ¥ª).
While they both consist of bread and a filling,
a sandwich typically has separate slices of bread,
while a hot dog has a single bun that is sliced
on the top and filled with a sausage.
```

Read
the [installation](#installation)
and [usage](#usage) instructions below.

### Installation

#### From source (recommended)

Either clone the repository to your machine and install from it,
or install directly from GitHub.
Both options require [Rust and Cargo to be installed](https://rustup.rs/).

```console
# Option 1: cloning and installing from the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/schneiderfelipe/getanswe.rs.git
$ cd getanswe.rs && cargo install answer --path=answer/

# Option 2: installing directly from GitHub
$ cargo install answer --git=https://github.com/schneiderfelipe/getanswe.rs
```

If you're looking to contribute to the project's development,
the first option is the way to go (and thank you for your interest!).
However,
if you simply want to install the development version,
the second option is likely the better choice.

### Environment Setup

Before using [`answer`ðŸ’­](https://crates.io/crates/answer),
you need to set up your environment to use
[`OpenAI`'s chat completion API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/chat-completions-beta)
(the same technology that powers `OpenAI`'s most advanced language model,
[`ChatGPT`](https://chat.openai.com/chat)).
To set up your environment,
you'll need to have a secret API key from `OpenAI`,
which can be obtained at
[`OpenAI`'s online platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Next,
set an environment variable in your shell as follows:

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-...a1b2"
```

### Usage

With your environment set up,
you're ready to start using
the command-line application.
Here's an example:

```console
$ echo "Date of birth of Malcolm X?" | answer
The date of birth of Malcolm X is May 19, 1925.
```

You can also get `answer`s in context by providing a YAML file containing
the initial part of a chat history.
For example:

```yaml
# birthdates.yml
messages:
  - role: system
    content: >-
      You are a date of birth checker.
      Given the name of a person,
      your job is to specify the date of birth of said person.
```

```console
$ echo "Malcolm X" | answer birthdates.yml
Malcolm X was born on May 19th, 1925.
```

The file format closely resembles both
[`OpenAI`'s higher-level API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction)
and
[its lower-level `ChatML` format](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/chatml.md).
