A command-line application for answering _any_ question right from your terminal.

```console
$ echo "ðŸŒ­ = ðŸ¥ª?" | answer

While they both consist of bread and a filling,
a sandwich typically has separate slices of bread,
while a hot dog has a single bun that is sliced
on the top and filled with a sausage.
```
