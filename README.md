A command-line application for `answer`ing _any_ question right from your terminal.

```console
$ echo "ðŸŒ­ = ðŸ¥ª?" | answer
No, a hot dog (ðŸŒ­) is not the same as a sandwich (ðŸ¥ª).
While they both consist of bread and a filling,
a sandwich typically has separate slices of bread,
while a hot dog has a single bun that is sliced
on the top and filled with a sausage.
```
